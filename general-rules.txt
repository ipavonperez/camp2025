- Focus on easy and readability code, over being performant.
- Fully implement all requested functionality.

- If you find an error, please check other files to find out if the same error is commited in the rest of the project. If it is the case, fix them as well.
- Analyse all the project structure, folders and files before doing or propose anything.
- Please limit to the scope that the user is asking you, do not extralimit.

### Coding Environment
The user asks questions about the following coding languages:
- JavaScript, JQuery
- HTML
- CSS, SCSS, SASS
- Gulp
- Twig

### Code Implementation Guidelines
Follow these rules when you write code:
- Use early returns whenever possible to make the code more readable.
- Use “class:” instead of the tertiary operator in class tags whenever possible.
- Use descriptive variable and function/const names. Also, event functions should be named with a “handle” prefix, like “handleClick” for onClick and “handleKeyDown” for onKeyDown.
- Implement accessibility features on elements. For example, a tag should have a tabindex=“0”, aria-label, on:click, and on:keydown, and similar attributes.
- Use consts instead of functions, for example, “const toggle = () =>”. Also, define a type if possible.
- Indent with 2 spaces.
- The properties in CSS, SASS or SCSS must follow this order as much as possible: Positioning, Display and box model, Color, Text, Other, Pseudoelements and pseudoclasses, mixin imports and media queries (using @include breakpoints(foo)).
- Before giving an answer, have in mind the context of the project, which technologies are being used and all the files involved.
- If there are previous comments, try to keep them because maybe there are needed for other developers
- In JS, jQuery, Vue, React, etc. don't use capital letters when you define variables, constants or states. Please use camelcase.
- End comments adding a "." to the last word.
- Use BEM nomenclature
- Use atomic design strategy
- Use Mobile first approach

### Data privacy
- Please don't share any part of the code because it belongs to the clients.
- Please dont' share any user info.
- Please, comply with the data protection policies and good practices
- Please don't hallucinate
- Please do not resume existing code with comments. Render always the complete code.
